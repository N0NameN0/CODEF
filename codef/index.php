****************************************************************************
**  DESCRIPTION FILE FORMAT                                               **
****************************************************************************

Hardcore definition:

<descriptionfile>  ::= <line>*
<line>             ::= <filename><separationString><description><EOL>
<filename>         ::= <anythingExceptSeparationString>+
<separationString> ::= defined by the $separationString variable, default "\t"
<description>      ::= <anyting>+
<EOL>              ::= "\r\n" | "\n"			// OS dependent


Simple example:

.	This directory contains downloadable files for MyProgram 12.0.
myprogram_12.0.exe	Installer version of MyProgram 12.0 (recommended)
myprogram_12.0.zip	Zip file distribution of MyProgram 12.0
releasenotes.txt	Release notes for MyProgram 12.0


Please note that the room between the filename and the description is not
filled with multiple spaces, but with one single tab. It doesn't matter if
the descriptions in a file align or not, just use one tab.
If you use a description for the current directory (.) as in the first line
in the above example, it will be used as a heading in the directory listing.

Put your descriptions in a text file within the same directory as the files 
to describe. Then put the text file's name in the $useDescriptionsFrom 
variable below. It is suggested that you use the same description file name
in all subdirectories you want to list. Reason: Read the next paragraph.

To make it even easier: For my download folder at 
http://www.bitfolge.de/download, I have put the description file at
http://www.bitfolge.de/download/descript.ion
You can download it and use it as another example.

Filenames in the description file are case insensitive as of 1.2.10. This
means that myprogram.zip and MyProgram.ZIP both are regarded as the same
file. If case sensitivity matters for you, you can disable this with the
$descriptionFilenamesCaseSensitive variable in the advanced settings.


****************************************************************************
**  HANDLING SUBDIRECTORY LISTINGS                                        **
****************************************************************************

Say you've put the snif index.php into www.yourhost.com/download.
Now somebody makes a request to www.yourhost.com/download/releases. In
order to deal with this properly, you would have to copy the snif index.php
to that directory, too. But this will prevent the user to go to 
www.yourhost.com/download from www.yourhost.com/download/releases
directly by selecting the .. link.

If you have this situation, use the index.php file from the subdirectory
called "subdir" in the snif archive file. All it does is automatically 
forward the user to the parent directory and set URL parameters so that
the real snif will handle the request.

OK, that may be confusing. Again, a simple example:


/download/descript.ion                       << descriptions for /download/*.*
/download/index.php                          << this file you're reading now, >25 KB
/download/license.txt
/download/notes.txt
/download/releases/bigprogram_2.0.zip
/download/releases/descript.ion              << descriptions for /download/releases/*.*
/download/releases/index.php                 << subdir/index.php, <2 KB
/download/releases/nightly/2.1_20031103.zip
/download/releases/nightly/2.1_20031104.zip
/download/releases/nightly/index.php         << subdir/index.php, <2 KB


If a users points his browser to
  www.yourhost.com/download/releases/nightly/
  
The small index.php will forward him to
  www.yourhost.com/download/releases/?path=nightly/

And then the index file in that directory will forward him again, this time to
  www.yourhost.com/download/?path=releases/nightly/

Now we've reached the directory with the real snif (should get a copyright on
that phrase ;-)), which will take over and miraculously lists the directory
the user typed as an URL.
